Data Classification with Deep Learning using TensorFlow

Water treatment plant dataset has been made from the daily measures of sensors which are used in the waste water treatment plant. The main objective is to classify the operational state of the plant in order to predict faults through the attributes of the water flowing in and out and variables of the plant corresponding to all the stages of the treatment process.

Used a 4 layer neural network multi-perceptron model, first layer corresponds to input nodes which takes the values of input attributes of data , hidden layers corresponds to the weight variables used and bias variables used and the final layer is the output layer which consists of three nodes corresponding to three output classes.
